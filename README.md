# snow-crab-fall-fishery-study

A study was conducted in the fall of 2020 to explore the feasibility of a fall fishery for Southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence snow crab.

# Purpose of Study

Collect samples of mature snow crabs in Crab Fishing Area (CFA) 12 in late fall of this year to verify the carapace condition and the meat content of the individuals sampled. These analyses will help evaluate if an eventual short late fall Snow crab fishing season is recommended in CFA 12. The main purpose of this initiative is to find alternatives to the reduced duration of the spring Snow crab fishing season when the North Atlantic Right Whale (NARW) aggregate in CFA 12 to feed.

Fishing activities will be 100% at-sea observer covered and space will be provided on the vessel to accommodate a technician/biologist. The at-sea observer will collect the carapace condition data, measure and weigh the crabs following the DFO Science protocol that will be shared with the ACA prior to the beginning of the activity. The ACA will include the results in the final report to DFO. The plan is to set and retrieve traps in four different areas (Baie des Chaleurs, “P’tit Platte”, the “Bradel” and the “Canal des Iles”) in one trip (weather permitted). The exact locations (grids) are provided in the Area of Activities section. Several Snow crab processing plants will be selected to analyse the meat content of the crab sampled to ensure a wide-ranging analysis. The processing plants will provide the ACA with a report on the findings, which ACA will include in the final report to DFO. An allocation of 1 metric ton (MT) of Snow crab will be needed for this purpose to ensure that a sufficient quantity of Snow crab can be analysed to conduct a full and complete analysis to determine if the quality of the Snow crab meets the market standards.
